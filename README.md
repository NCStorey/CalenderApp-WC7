# CalenderApp-WC7

## Description

This project was made in response to the Trilogy Front End Bootcamp Weekly Challenge 7 - Calender application.

We were tasked with this user story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

and given some basic starter code. 

The requirements were as follows:

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
 
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
 
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page


## Installation

No additional installation should be needed. The files were created in Visual Studio Code and consist of the basic website format - html, css, javascript, png.

## Usage

To be used by anyone who wants a simple daily planner.

To be used by Trilogy Education to asses how will I met the acceptance criteria.

To be used by anyone as a study guide - I tried to make copius notes to show my logic throught the creation of the script

Finally it was used by me as a great way to practice coding!
